# Muted-Game
My second game made in Elm while doing a PPP(Personal Passion Project)

It's a arena platformer. The game revolves around a rainbow character running away and fighting the "Muted", a group of black and white monsters. The monsters have to melee to deal damage and when they do the protaginist gets more and more "Muted", his body getting less colourful.

Time runs slow when the character's speed is low and time runs normally when they are going fast.
